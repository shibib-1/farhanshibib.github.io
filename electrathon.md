🚗 IEEE ElectraThon Electric Vehicle Project
Overview

As part of the IEEE ElectraThon team, I am contributing to the design and development of a three-wheeled electric vehicle featuring an in-house battery system, onboard smart electronics, and real-time telemetry for race-day monitoring.

This is a multi-semester project (Fall 2025 – Spring 2026) involving mechanical fabrication, power electronics, and embedded systems integration.

🔧 Project Scope & Timeline
Fall 2025 — Design & System Planning

Designed the vehicle from scratch, including CAD modeling and overall system layout

Researched Battery Management System (BMS) architectures and smart system requirements

Built a 7s3p lithium battery pack dedicated to powering the onboard smart system

Investigated telemetry architecture and CAN-based data acquisition

Spring 2026 — Fabrication & Integration (Current Phase)

Assisting with chassis cutting and welding for hardware integration

Developing a Raspberry Pi–based smart system to:

Display a real-time driver GUI

Read and process CAN bus data from the motor controller

Transmit telemetry to a trackside base station on race day

Monitor tire pressure

Control RGB lighting and onboard audio

👨‍💻 My Contributions

Battery System

Spot-welded and assembled a 7s3p battery pack

Researched USB Type-C interfaces for BMS connectivity

Studied CC pin signaling and communication protocols

Telemetry & Embedded Systems

Designing a LoRa-based telemetry link between the vehicle and base station

Working on reverse engineering a CAN bus reader by analyzing analog signals from the motor controller

Assisting in PCB design for the smart system hardware stack

Designing a buck converter for regulated voltage distribution

🧠 Challenges & Learning
Challenges

Entered the project with no prior experience in power electronics or embedded vehicle systems

Found technical documentation difficult to interpret (CC pins, BMS protocols, CAN signals)

No initial experience with PCB design or hardware layout

How I Addressed Them

Dedicated independent study time using:

Datasheets and technical manuals

Engineering tutorials and lectures

Learned PCB design fundamentals over winter break

Collaborated with senior team members to understand system-level integration

Applied knowledge through hands-on prototyping and testing

🛠️ Skills Developed

Battery pack design (7s3p configuration)

Spot welding and hardware assembly

CAN bus fundamentals and signal analysis

LoRa telemetry communication

Raspberry Pi embedded systems

PCB design and layout fundamentals

Power electronics (buck converter design)

🔭 Next Steps

Complete CAN decoding and integrate it with the Raspberry Pi interface

Finalize and manufacture the smart system PCB

Complete full telemetry integration before competition

Improve reliability and real-time data visualization for driver feedback

💡 Reflection

This project has been a major step forward in my development as an electrical engineer. I started with limited experience in power and embedded systems, but through self-study, teamwork, and hands-on building, I’ve gained practical skills in battery systems, telemetry, and embedded hardware design.
